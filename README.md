# Slackmond

Slackmond is a bridge between Almond and Slack. It exposes an existing Web Almond as a Slack bot in your workspace.

## Interacting with the bot

You should tag the bot to catch its attention:
> gcampax: @Almond, tell me a joke  
> Almond: "Dad, I'm hungry." Hello, Hungry. I'm Dad.  

When the bot is asking a question, you can answer without tagging it:
> gcampax: @Almond, post on Twitter  
> Almond: What do you want to post?  
> gcampax: I love Almond!  
> Almond: Ok, so you want me to post "I love Almond!" on Twitter. Is that right?  
> gcampax: Yes  
> Almond: Consider it done. 

Multiple users can interact with Almond at the same time. Almond keeps a context for each user,
so they do not interfere, even in the same channel.
